# Known Limitations

- Public datasets may not reflect real enterprise or CII topology.
- Attack labels may not provide complete ground-truth MITRE stage transitions.
- Flow and packet features may have different coverage depending on input source.
- Recursive rollout can accumulate prediction error.
- Feature attribution indicates model evidence, not causality.
- Probability estimates require calibration and should not be treated as certainty.
- Encrypted traffic limits payload-level interpretation.
- The prototype does not replace production SOC controls or authorize automatic response.

This file must be updated whenever an evaluation or demo reveals a new limitation.
